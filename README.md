# motherboards

When I was a teenager, my amazing parents bought me a 64k Color Computer from Radio Shack. We got home and my father hooked it up to an unused Zenith.

From the color of the TV (tuned to a dead channel) my new landscape emerged.

Motoring through the BASIC manual, I was hooked. I spent the Summer of ’85 coding a lunar landing game from the pages of  CoCo Magazine. Without a doubt, I met my first missing character.

We are surrounded by motherboards. You have one or two on your person right now. They have evolved from backplanes connecting printed components to incredibly dense layer cakes absorbing peripherals and solid state drives. Everytime I touch my iPhone, I am keenly aware that this device is a gagillion times more powerful than what first took us into space.

If I am essentially energy floating in water, how close am I to these integrated circuit boards? Was Diebenkorn as inspired by the Bay Area developers as I am by Silicon Valley’s?

In my mind, I imagine information moving, spliced into arrays, and converted into formats. This current series is a manfestation of those internal processes.

For this GitHub repo, you are free to download it and use the images on your deviecs. Don't crop the footer logo off of them - if they propogate, I would like there be some trace to route back to me, the originator.

That said, if you want, fork this repo, make derivaties, add them to the repo and send me a pull request! I would love to see what you come up with :)
